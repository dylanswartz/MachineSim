Load 5 into ACC
Zero out ACC by using REM (5 % 5 = 0)
Add mem loc 100 to ACC (99)
Store ACC in mem loc 201 (99)
Write mem loc 201 (99)
Goto mem loc 24 (skiping halt)
Halt. (Should be skippped)
Add mem loc 101 to ACC (1)
Divide ACC by 10
Multiply ACC by 5
Store ACC in mem loc 201 
Write mem loc 201
Decrement ACC
Branch to mem loc 28 while ACC > 0
Store ACC in mem loc 201
Write mem loc 201
Subtract 10 from ACC (acc = -10)
Increment ACC
Branch to mem loc 2d while ACC < 0
Store
Write
If ACC == zero goto mem loc 50
else Halt
Load 5 into ACC
Store
Write
Halt.
